prototype
=========
A library for prototyping c++ class using LUA (from LUA's point of view).

What is prototype
-----------------
Although the name can be "slightly" missleading, it's purpose is straight on. The purpose of this library
is to enable the developer to prototype and extend exposed c++ class methods using the scripting language: LUA.

I've planned on using this library for a game engine i've planned to develop later and a scripting language
is a must when doing that. This project is in reality a project for myself learning the LUA API but if the end
result can be of use for other people then that would be awesome.
